# FUSE Filesystem

*Configuration and operation of the FUSE virtual filesystem.*

[Back to Architecture Overview](../DESIGN.md)

## Configuration Format

### Per-Mapping Config Files

Each dedup operation creates TWO files:
1. `.mkvdup` - The dedup data file (index + delta)
2. `.mkvdup.yaml` - Config file for this mapping

**Individual mapping config (video1.mkvdup.yaml):**

```yaml
# Auto-generated by mkvdup create
name: "Video1.mkv"
dedup_file: "/data/dedup/video1.mkvdup"
source_dir: "/data/sources/Video1_DVD"
```

### Master Config with Includes

**Main config (/etc/mkvdup/mount.yaml):**

```yaml
mountpoint: /mnt/media

# Include individual mapping configs
includes:
  - "/data/dedup/video1.mkvdup.yaml"
  - "/data/dedup/video2.mkvdup.yaml"
  - "/data/dedup/*.mkvdup.yaml"  # Glob patterns supported

# Can also define inline (optional)
virtual_files:
  - name: "Videos/Collection1/Video3.mkv"
    dedup_file: "/data/dedup/video3.mkvdup"
    source_dir: "/data/sources/Collection1_Bluray"
```

## Directory Structure

The FUSE filesystem presents a virtual directory tree:

```
/mnt/media/                          (mountpoint)
└── Videos/
    ├── Video1.mkv                   (virtual file)
    ├── Video2.mkv                   (virtual file)
    └── Collection1/
        ├── Video3.mkv               (virtual file)
        ├── Video4.mkv               (virtual file)
        └── Video5.mkv               (virtual file)
```

## Hot Reload Support

The FUSE daemon supports live config reload without restart:

**Signal-based reload:**
```bash
# Send SIGHUP to reload config
kill -HUP $(pidof mkvdup)
```

**File-watch reload:**
- Daemon watches config file and include directories
- Automatically reloads when changes detected
- Uses inotify for efficient monitoring

**On reload:**
- New virtual files become immediately available
- Removed virtual files become unavailable (active readers continue until close)
- Modified mappings: existing readers use old mapping until close
- Stale permissions entries are cleaned up

## Permissions and Ownership

Virtual files support `chmod` and `chown` operations. Metadata is stored in a separate permissions file.

**Permissions file location:**
- Default: `~/.config/mkvdup/permissions.yaml`
- Configurable via `--permissions-file` or in mount config

**Permissions file format:**
```yaml
# Auto-managed by mkvdup daemon (also human-editable)
# Changes are picked up on SIGHUP reload

files:
  "Videos/Video1.mkv":
    uid: 1000
    gid: 1001
    mode: 0640
  "Videos/Video2.mkv":
    mode: 0444  # read-only, inherits uid/gid from defaults
```

**Default behavior (when file not in permissions.yaml):**
1. Use daemon defaults from config/command line if specified
2. Otherwise use `root:root` (uid=0, gid=0) with mode `0644`

**CLI/config options for defaults:**
```bash
# Mount with custom default ownership
mkvdup mount --config mount.yaml --default-uid 1000 --default-gid 1000 --default-mode 0644

# Or in mount config yaml
defaults:
  uid: 1000
  gid: 1000
  mode: 0644
  permissions_file: /var/lib/mkvdup/permissions.yaml
```

## Memory Management

**Goal:** Keep memory footprint low even with many virtual files.

**Strategy: Lazy loading with reference counting**

Files are NOT memory-mapped at startup. Instead:

1. **On file open (FUSE Open):**
   - Increment reference count
   - If first open: memory-map the dedup file and source files
   - Parse index entries via `sync.Once` (thread-safe)

2. **On file close (FUSE Release):**
   - Decrement reference count
   - If count reaches 0: unmap all files

**Result:**
- At startup: Only config parsed, no files mapped
- During playback: Only active files are mapped
- After playback: Files unmapped, memory returned to OS
- 100 configured videos = ~0 memory if none are playing

**Optional:** Add a configurable grace period before unmapping (e.g., 30 seconds after close) to avoid repeated map/unmap for quick seeks.

## Multi-threading

go-fuse supports multi-threaded operation for concurrent request handling:

```yaml
# In mount config
performance:
  threads: 0              # 0 = auto (NumCPU), or specify count
  read_ahead_kb: 128      # Kernel read-ahead buffer size
  max_background: 12      # Max background FUSE requests
  congestion_threshold: 9 # When to start throttling
```

**Benefits of multi-threading:**

| Scenario | Single-threaded | Multi-threaded |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| One video playing | OK | Same |
| Multiple videos playing | Serialized reads, stuttering | Parallel reads, smooth |
| Player read-ahead | Blocks other reads | Parallel prefetch |
| Multiple users | Poor | Good |

**Tuning guidance:**

| Workload | Recommended threads | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| Single user, local playback | 2-4 | Low overhead |
| Media server (Jellyfin/Plex) | NumCPU | Multiple streams |
| NAS with many users | NumCPU * 2 | I/O bound |
| Low-power device | 1-2 | Reduce CPU usage |

## Health Checks

Optional background health monitoring:

```yaml
# In mount config
health_check:
  enabled: true
  interval: 1h           # Check every hour
  check_source_sizes: true
  check_source_checksums: false  # Too slow for routine checks
  on_error: warn         # warn, disable_file, or unmount
```

## Source File Watching

Optional inotify-based monitoring of source files:

```yaml
# In mount config
source_watch:
  enabled: true
  on_change: checksum    # checksum, disable_file, or warn
  checksum_threads: 2    # Parallel checksum workers
```

**On source file change:**
- `warn`: Log warning only
- `disable_file`: Mark affected virtual files as unavailable
- `checksum`: Verify source file checksum, disable if changed

## Error Handling

| Error | Impact | Recovery |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Dedup file missing | Virtual file unavailable | Return ENOENT |
| Dedup file corrupt | Virtual file unavailable | Return EIO, log error |
| Source file missing | Virtual file unavailable | Return EIO |
| Source file wrong size | Virtual file unavailable | Return EIO |
| Config file invalid | Mount/reload fails | Log error, keep old config |

When errors occur for a specific virtual file, other files remain accessible. Files with persistent errors automatically retry after a 5-minute cooldown period.

## inotify Events

The FUSE filesystem emits standard inotify events when the config is reloaded:
- `IN_CREATE` for added files
- `IN_DELETE` for removed files

Applications watching the mountpoint (e.g., Jellyfin/Plex) will automatically detect changes.
